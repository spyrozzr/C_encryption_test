This is an encryption test in the C programming language.

______________________________________________________

In this test we will encrypt an input string using a substitution cypher. This will be done as follows:
- Using a "caesar cipher". shifting all characters in the string by a fixed amount.
- Using 2 different custom keys, all different to each other.

We will also create a program to decipher a "caesar cipher" encryption type

By creating this project we aim to internalize the introductory concepts of cryptography, as
well as enhance our C programming skills.
